{-| With `Porter.Multi` you can create requests that have specialized return values.
Use this if the normal response types are not good enough for you.

The setup is exactly the same as when using Porter normally; and just use the `request` and `send` commands that this module provides instead to create requests with specialized return types.

Mapping over responses and chaining requests is supported.

{-| We can either:

  - Perform a single request, which will run the Porter Request and at the end turn the result into an `a`,
  - Perform multiple requests: At the end of this request, run a function on the output that generates the next request. Note that this is set up in such a way that only the type of the final request in the chain matters.
  - Short-circuit; just pass on the value `a` without doing any more requests.

-}
type alias Request req res a =
    Porter.Internals.MultiRequest req res a


{-| Creates a new Porter.Multi request, specifying:

  - the request itself in the common `req` type
  - A response handler function tha turns the common `res` type into a specialized `a`.

-}
request : req -> (res -> a) -> Request req res a
request req responseHandler =
    SimpleRequest (Porter.request req) responseHandler


{-| Combines together multiple Porter.Multi requests

            ComplexRequest porterReq (\res -> andThen reqfun (nextRequestFun res))

        ShortCircuit val ->
            reqfun val


{-| andThenResult function similar to `andThen`,
but will short-circuit the request/response chain once an `Err val` is received.

Working with Result-objects is very common, since the specialising of `res -> a` (that you pass to `request`) is usually an operation that might fail (like a Decoder)

{-| Turns the request's specialized response type into a different type.
-}
map : (a -> b) -> Request req res a -> Request req res b
map mapfun req =
    Porter.Internals.multiMap mapfun req


{-| Chains two requests, and then combines their two responses into one new `c`.
-}

map2 mapfun reqA reqB =
    reqA

{-| Chains three requests, and then combines their three responses into one new `c`.
-}
map3 : (a -> b -> c -> d) -> Request req res a -> Request req res b -> Request req res c -> Request req res d
map3 mapfun reqA reqB reqC =
    reqA
        |> andThen (\resA -> map2 (mapfun resA) reqB reqC)


{-| Actually sends a (chain of) request(s).

A final handler needs to be specified that turns the final result into a `msg`.
This `msg` will be called with the final resulting `a` once the final response has returned.

-}
send : Config req res msg -> (a -> msg) -> Request req res a -> Cmd msg
send config msgHandler request =
    Porter.Internals.multiSend config msgHandler request
